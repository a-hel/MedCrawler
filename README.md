Disclaimer
----------

MedCrawler requires you to download the Medical Term Indexer Web API from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). To use that service, a Unified Medical Language System(r) (UMLS) user account is necessary.

MedCrawler does not contain any data or information from the UMLS Metathesaurus. It is the user's responsibility to respect the UMLS license agreement when using MedCrawler to access and use UMLS content.

Part of the program is based on the work of Jim Mork (2006) at NLM.
