Installation
============

MedCrawler is available from Github (`<https://github.com/a-hel/MedCrawler.git>`_).

You also need to download the MeSH descriptors as xml (e.g. <desc2016.xml>) separately and save/unzip it to the ``MedCrawler`` folder (not the ``/src``). It is available from the National Library of Medicine at `<https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/download\_mesh.html>`_ .
