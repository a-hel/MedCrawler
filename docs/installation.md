#Installation

##Requirements

You need Python 2.7 and Java.

##Install the Web API

The module relies on the UMLS Web API for MeSH term extraction. In order to use it, you need to apply for a free UMLS license. Approval of your request can take up to three days.

Sign up for an UMLS license:  https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/home.html -> Request a license
Once your request is approved, you will recieve your UMLS username and password.

Afterwards, download the NLM Medical Text Indexer API: https://ii.nlm.nih.gov/Web_API/index.shtml

Unzip the _jar_ archive and copy the unzipped folder into the /bin directory. Make sure the folder is named "SKR_Web_API_V2_1" and rename if necessary.
