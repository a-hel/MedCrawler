Whenever Ayyoob As-Sakhstiyaanee (a Taabiee) spoke, his heart would become mellow and his eyes would flush with tears immediately, but then he would say, How severe is this flu that Im suffering from! An-Nakhee used to recite the Quraan but whenever someone entered upon him he would immediately cover it (so no one would know his good deed). Ibn Abee Layla used to pretend to be asleep if someone entered upon him while praying. Al-Hasan Al-Basree once said, Men (before) used to forbear shedding their tears whenever their tears began to well up (from their fear of Allaah), and if they feared they would be unable to conceal their tears from being noticed by others, they would leave the place so that no one could see them. [Kitaab Al-Lataaif Fil-Waaiz, by Ibn Al-Jawzee, p. 86]
