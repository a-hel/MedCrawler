Oh how I hate you Respiratory Flu! My temperature is burning hot it seems that now all Ive got is an AWFULlot of snot My nose just keeps onrunning likea rabid waterfall. Myears just keep onplugging andI cannot hear at all. Then theres theballoon. Oh wait I guess thats my head It feels like itwillfloat away soon or maybe just explode instead Everyone knows how much I enjoyhumor but when I laughmy lungsstart burning which trigger nonstop coughing until I cough one up ontothe floor And OH the horrid NOISE  not just the snorting, blowing and hacking but NOW myvoice is squeaking and cracking and Isound like pubescent 13year-old BOYS!! No prescription from the pharmacy Will cure this malady Except suggestions of lotsof soups and tea But the only thing that is helpingis making lots ofpee. ESPECIALLY, it seems, when I have to SNEEZE!! I have to do something to make me drink more liquid and block out the noise making my ears ring I raise my cracking voice and Sing: Tis the the season to be snotty Falalalala lala la la I really need a strong hot toddy Falalalala lala LaLAAA! From me to all of you, as I spread cheer while Kung Flu Fighting.
