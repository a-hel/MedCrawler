 You already have these two power players in your house, but you likely dont know just how heroic honey and cinnamon when joined together! I found out their rockstar repertoire while I was researching an anti-acne face mask (1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbl honey). So, whip that up, spread it on your face, and read this as they go to work! Taken together, honey and cinnamon can help you lose weight (regulating glucose levels and metabolism), raise defenses (take for three days straight to heal colds/cough/flu), improve digestion, curb sugar cravings, heal joints, treat insomnia and stress (I take organic Kratom for this reason, also),and increase libido (a spoonful in the morning and at night I hear really ramps up the romance)! Just make sure the ones you buy are quality, organic, raw and pure! Oh, and feel free to read more about these two ingredients because even on their own, they work dozens of other miracles!
