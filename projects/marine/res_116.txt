A new study published this week suggests that deaths from the flu in older people arent from the influenza virus. Theyre from a damaging immune response in their bodies. The two main strains of the influenza virus cause as many ashalf a million deaths a year worldwide, with 90 per cent occurring in adults 65 or older. According to the Yale-led study, published in the journal Science, researchers attempted to understand why older people are more susceptible to the virus than any other group. Researchers compared the effects of the flu on cells taken from older and younger people and found that theway theimmune system fights viruses drops with age.

Researchers replicated an elderly immune system by (blocking) genes that enable the immune system to detect flu, allowing the virus to replicate unchecked. By examining the results, researchers determined that inflammation causes the majority of flu related deaths. (The discovery has)a lot of promise in terms of how we might treat older people who are infected with flu, said Iwasaki. If what we see in the mouse is true for humans, instead of trying to block virus replication, we should go after the immune cells that are destroying the lungs.
