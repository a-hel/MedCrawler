The intention of the essay is to describe in personal detail the severity and impact the epidemic of influenza that disrupted and devastated the lives of the victims of the disease in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Also, the intention of the essay is to make the reader aware that this disease took more lives than World War 1 which was being fought at the same time as the influenza outbreak.  A child whose life is no longer given a name or a length, so short it is remembered by the one fact of his death. This quote is significant to this essay because it describes how quickly the disease could infest a person, so much that children were being born just to die from the influenza without even receiving an identity to be remembered by when the disease passes. Brox definitely uses the appeal of pathos throughout this essay through her carefully controlled description of the pain and loss the people of Massachusetts endured making the reader care and sympathize with the local people. Broxsuse of descriptive detail is effective in making this a memorable piece. Her careful attention to sights, sounds, smells, and touch allow the reader to fully immerse himself/herself into the setting ofTower Hill and the sight of people entering the tent hospital and leaving in coffins while children played outside like nothing was happening.
