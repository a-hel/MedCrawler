I have a passion for vintage & antique items ..which my Beloved hold testament to, every room in The Cottage holds items I treasure, and each one has a story to tell, now sit back have a cuppa to hand and Ill tell you all about the letters from the front These are the said letters, from a Mr Link to his loving wife which date from the 1914- 1918 war I bought these letters from an auction in Lincoln, and were from an elderly ladies estate which transpired to be the newborn daughter mentioned in the letters, I only have the notes sent from the husband home to his young wife so really only have half the story. They are just simple observations of the day seen through his eyes.. the weather, asking for socks, the price of a new bicycle his wife wanted to buy ~ at 6 shillings it was outrageous and it was recommended his dear wife buys one from the local farmer !! Mr & Mrs Links, they look so young what a handsome couple they must have made Mr Link mentions lost comrades in his unit, which were local village lads, as during the first world war villagers enlisted together, as the war drew to an end he writes of his homecoming and how they really ought to get Baby christened, he survived the war but unfortunately caught a bad cold just before being demobbed, imagine how a sob caught in my throat when at the bottom of the box along with 2 photographs I came across a black edged mourning card Mr Links was a casualty of the great 1918 influenza pandemic so never did come home
