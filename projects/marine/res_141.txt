[anvplayer video=870737 /] (ABC News)  The sniffles, sneezes, and aches that come with the flu. Annoying to be sure. But now new research suggests that pregnant women who get their flu shot might be sidestepping more than just these symptoms. They may be saving their babies. Researchers in Australia studied more than 58,000 births over a year and found that pregnant women who were vaccinated against the flu had only half the risk of stillbirth at delivery  compared to women who skipped this shot.   The study shows not only that the influenza vaccination was safe and effective for these women but that it may also provide better chances for an unborn babys survival. The CDC currently recommends that all women who are pregnant get their flu shot, unless they have a serious medical reason not to. This study may give moms-to-be one more reason to heed this advice.  If you are pregnant or know someone who is, its time for that flu vaccination. A babys life may depend on it.
