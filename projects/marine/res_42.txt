If someone receivesthe flu vaccine, theres a better chance theyll get through flu season without getting sick. But because the flu vaccine isnt 100 percent effective, they might still end upinfected despite the vaccine.

If you get the flu vaccine, and you end up with  lotsa barfin', the flu vaccine didnt fail, you got some other virus. Why do people think that flu causes vomiting?
