Ferocious vaccine manufacturers are constantly on the move, looking for new demographics to shoot with vaccines. If they could stick a needle into a rock and get paid for it, they would find a reason to do it. But in this case, were talking about pregnant women. Protection, protection, protectionthats the cover the government keeps pushing. Meanwhile, the vaccines theyre foisting on pregnant women have a track record of damage. Barbara Loe Fisher, head of the National Vaccine Information Center, has the story, so Ill let her tell it. These are excerpts from her testimony before the Nov. 13, 2015 meeting of the FDA Vaccines & Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) on proposed changes to FDA requirements for licensure of vaccines intended for use during pregnancy: Fisher (FDA Prepares to Fast Track New Vaccines Targeting Pregnant Women, 11/17/2016): In 2006, CDC officials directed doctors to give all pregnant women a flu shot and, in 2011, a Tdap shot during every pregnancy, no matter how little time has elapsed between pregnancies. Prior to FDA licensure, influenza, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines [Tdap and flu shots] were not tested in or proven safe and effective for pregnant women in large clinical trials when given during every pregnancy either singly or simultaneously. Categorized by FDA as Pregnancy Category B and C biologicals because it is not known whether the vaccines are genotoxic and can cause fetal harm or can affect maternal fertility and reproduction, administering influenza and Tdap vaccines to pregnant women is an off-label use of these vaccines. It is a policy that assumes maternal vaccination is necessary, safe and effective without proving it. Read more here
