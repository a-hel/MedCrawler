    Every year between 3000 and 49000 people in the US die as a result of the influenza virus. Researchers of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  (NIAID)  conducted a study and found  factors that may influence the influenza vaccine  and its effectiveness. 65 volunteers between the ages of 18-50 willingly participated in the human challenge study. This research exposed 25 participants to high levels of anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies and 40 participants to low level of anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies. Each participant was also administered the H1N1 virus. This research study exposing volunteers to disease-causing pathogens was conducted under carefully controlled conditions. The researchers found the group that where administered higher levels of anti-HA antibodies experienced significantly lower mild to moderate influenza. This is a significant because research suggests the high HA antibody may limit viril shedding or the spread from person to person.
