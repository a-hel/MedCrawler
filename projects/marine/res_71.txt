Thoughts I had while fighting the flu: Is this what it feels like to become a vampire? How did this get through my defenses? Has The Fish Taco been lying dormant all this time? Joan and James are being so nice to me. Joan and James are being too nice to me. Can theysense what I cannot  imminentdeath? I am going to die alone. I am going to die alone up here in this attic,in this stupid Megalodon t-shirt. (Dying alone has been a recurringfear of mine ever since I realized I dont know how to perform the Heimlich to others, or to myself. Twice Ive chipped teeth while eating too quickly, so choking doesnt seem too far fetched.) When will my cool fever dreams kick in? I had no idea cats could sleep so much. Fever hair. Is that a dreadlock? While hopped upon Sudaphed:Why do people do meth? While cryingin the urgent care parking lot: I really need cat litter. And Feeder Supply is right there. But I cant be the girl whowalks in crying, buys cat litter and leaves. I am the girl who walkedin crying, boughtcat litter and left. Should I call everyone I had contact with late last week?Or is that only appropriate withSTDs? What if my boss thinksIm lying? Because really, who gets the flu in May? Maybe this isnt the flu. This definitely isnt the flu. While searching my body for ticks:I must haveLyme disease. While searching my body for mosquito bites:I must have Zika. While searching my body for clawmarks: I must have Cat Scratch Fever.Oh, God. What a horribly ironic way to die.  fin
