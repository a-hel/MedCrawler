This years flu season in Saskatchewan started late and is dragging on longer than usual, although the number of new lab-confirmed cases is slowly dwindling. Here are the latest numbers: 14 Deaths due to influenza since Sept. 1 49 The number of admissions to intensive care units since Sept. 1 76 The number of new lab-confirmed cases for the week of April 3-9 2,902 The total number of lab-confirmed cases since Sept. 1 32 Outbreaks in long-term health-care facilities since Sept. 1 The numbers are an underestimate. Not all people seek medical care and are tested for influenza, and not all those who died with influenza-like illness were tested. Due to the late start of the flu season, the provincial influenza immunization program has been extended until April 30.
