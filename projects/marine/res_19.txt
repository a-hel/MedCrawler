My hair looks good today, I polished away the flu with a little blush, and Im wearing that LBD that makes every day a good day. Even though its Monday  or maybe it especially brightens up a Monday. I want to sit down in a bar, with a way to densely written 19th century novel, order a small glass of wine (or two), and be a model citizen by helping an old lady carry her suitcase up the stairs when I catch the S-bahn back. I feel like the embodiment of the French je ne sais quoi and all I want to do is carelessly light a cigarette, whilst Im strutting through the streets of Berlin. The only problem is Im not in France, and I dont know enough of German sayings  all I know is that the grammar frustrates me. No strut, just running my eyes over foreign words that look too similar to my first language. No bars, no wine, no cigarettes, because its still that ever dreaded Monday and I dont smoke. Then againCest la vie has always been more powerful than Je ne sais quoi.
