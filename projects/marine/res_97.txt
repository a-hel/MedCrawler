By the time WWII had broken out, Burnett had become a very accomplished virologist.He had made significant progress in many diseases of his time, including influenza, herpes, poliomyelitis and Murray Valley Encephalitis.He had also discovered the causative agents in the bacterial diseases of Q fever and Psittacosis, Coxiella Burnetti, which was named in his honour. Also, by this time he had risen to the role of acting director in the Walter and Eliza institute.Now, with this influence, he focused the institutes efforts to find cures to wartime sicknesses, most prominently an influenza vaccine as nobody anted a repeat of the1918 (post WW1) flu pandemic. Dora Lush He also expanded the institutes research into scrub typhus, an infections disease that was common among the soldier posted in the tropical regions Queensland and Papua New Guinea.Miss Dora Lush, a colleague of Burnett, died as a result of this research as she accidentally pricked herself with a needle containing the virus.This tragedy effectively ended the research. A influenza vaccine was soon developed, and after testing it out on medical students, and then 107 soldiers on February 1942 after a rise in infections, the results seemed promising.However,after a national program was launched and 20,000 people were vaccinated, it proved ineffective. Burnett spent much of his career focusing on the influenza virus.He had (previously) isolated a strain of influenza A virus in Australia, attempted again to create a influenza vaccine,studied the genetics of the influenza virus and its similarities to the Australian swine flu. A particularly significant and memorable scientific breakthrough was Burnetts method of cultivating viruses.As W.I.B Beveridge as his partner, they devised the technique for cultivating viruses on the membrane of chicken embryos.They also discovered a method to determining the concentration of material injected into the membrane by counting the lesions that appear on the membranes.Naturally, Burnett inoculated the membranes with a strain of influenza virus.
