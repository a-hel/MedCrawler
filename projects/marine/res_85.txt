 Back in 2010, when I was working at the health department, a reporter from 1030AM in DC asked to do an interview with me about influenza. It was the beginning of the 2010-2011 season, and the whole EpiGate fiasco hadnt happened. So the bosses allowed me to do the interview with her. (Also, they didnt have many people who spoke Spanish.) So I sat down and talked to her over the phone for about half an hour. We talked about influenza surveillance, the disease, and even some virology. It was actually a really good interview. I felt very at ease. Listening to it now, I can hear some grammatical mistakes here and there from me trying to translate my knowledge of influenza  which I learned in English  into what Im saying in Spanish. Spanish has a lot of conventions that need to be followed, and I was a bit rusty. Since then, Ive made an effort to speak and write it to as many people as I can. It would be ridiculous, in my opinion, to not be able to speak it fluently one day when I think in Spanish and when everyone in my dreams speaks Spanish. (Yeah, its weird.) Also, its my first language, and I hope to pass it on to any eventual Big Fat Baby Ren. So here it is, 28 minutes of me talking about influenza in Spanish. (If you dont understand Spanish, then youll just have to wait until the next Talking Tuesday.)  https://epiren.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/1030am-interview-11-18-30.mp3 As always, you can download the episode by clicking here.
