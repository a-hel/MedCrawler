Well, its been a long, painful week. I am finally feeling back to normal after coming down with a new horrible version of the flu. I went to work on Monday, left after we closed and went straight to our emergency care place to find out what was wrong with me. My throat had been hurting all day and just got significantly worse by later in the evening and it hurt so badly that I was actually crying at work. Not okay. They swabbed me for strep and nothing came back. The doctor put me on an antibiotic and said I should be feeling much better by Wednesday. I felt moderately better Tuesday night, but woke up feeling significantly worse Wednesday morning. My throat was hurting still, but my ears and head were throbbing too. I spent the day sleeping, and did not go into work. Thursday I felt better but still not any good, I had to go into work for a few hours with not much of a voice to help out the managers with a coverage issue. By Thursday night I was feeling pretty Okay and yesterday I felt like a new person. I worked my regular shift and came home and passed out. This morning has been rough getting out of bed because it is chilly outside! Its been pretty warm the past several days but now its in the 50s outside and I would love nothing more than to just stay put and curl up with some blankets and pillows. Alas, no work will get done that way. Off I go for now. ~Aud
