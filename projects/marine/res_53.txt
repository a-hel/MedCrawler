We all have to deal with this every year. If you can go a year without being sick then youre a unique individual. Ive been fighting a common cold/flu during the last few weeks and it has slown me down in regards to physical training. Ive learned from experience that exercising while being sick is a very bad move and it should be avoided. In my opinion when youre dealing with a cold or a flu the best thing to do is to minimize your physical activity, drink A LOT of fluids, especially water, and make sure to get enough sleep. Besides from that all you can do is to wait for your body to get rid of the virus/bacteria thats keeping you down.
