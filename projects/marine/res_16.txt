After more than a week of trying to self medicate my cough, I decided to throw in the towel and see a doctor. I was so close to the end of the tunnel though. I could see the light of health on the other side. Finally, I cango back to being a gymhead and lift heavy things up and put them down. Finally,I cango back to subjecting myself to the mind-numbingly and torturous routine of dragonboating. But it was not to be. My descent into the pit of sickness was not over. A flu brought me down.   The doctor asked if I wanted someof my medication to be of the slightly drowsy kind. I was like, hell yeah, I need those. I need my sleep after hacking out cough after cough through the night. Okay I didnt sayhell yeah. But I gave her the affirmative that drowsy medication isthe way to go. Unfortunately ITS NOT WORKING ON ME. I took those medication 2 hours ago and Im still wide awake. WHAT THE FUCK, THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING. Talking about advertising, what happens when a Frenchman, a Spanish dude and two Singapore guys walk into a club? Take a guess before you scroll down.                 Have you guess yet? Keep scrolling.                      Almost there.      You got this.                          Nothing happens. Cause theyre all from the social media team busy with social media stuff. As oneof my colleagues love to say: Were from social media but yet were anti-social. Wiser words have never been spoken. Now Im gonna watch stupid shit on YouTube.  ____________________________________________ I realised I havent been sharingmusic videos Ive watched. So heres a blast from the past. The Taiwanese singer/rapper is called Ah Liang. I cant remember the girls name but she was a popularTaiwanese singer/actress. Dont ask me what the song is about. I dont understand Chinese. Seriously, did you not read the About Me section? Enjoy the shitty compression.
