Ive had the flu for about a week and a half (this is the first time in several years that I have had it) My nephew today made me some tea, because I kept forgetting about it after setting the kettle to boil (its an electric kettle, thats why it was easy to forget). He also made some peanut butter cookies and brought me some. That last is partially because hes been wanting cookies for a week and Ive been too sick to make them and partially because they were dry, so I could eat them and keep them down, but also with peanut butter so that there was some nutrition with them as well. Im grateful for his kindness today as I just feel crummy. (He also tucked me in with extra blankets so that Im actually warm.) Check out the original Thankful Thursday. (Will update link when able.)
