[anvplayer video=863505 /] MASON CITY, Iowa  The Department of Public Health has confirmed that influenza is officially in Cerro Gordo County. Health officials say they have had several rapid tests come back positive, but this is the first coming from the State Hygienic Lab to test positive, which is the only time it can be confirmed in the county. If it seems a little late this year, thats because it is later than normal, which could be because the vaccine does cover the strain that is being passed around. I think last year we were looking at maybe the beginning of January that we saw our first confirmed, now remember that might not have been the first ones on the rapid testing that was done in the clinics and that. According to the CDC, influenza is low for the state of Minnesota and minimal in the state of Iowa at this point. Stiles says the biggest things to do are cover your coughs and sneezes, clean your hands frequently and contain germs by staying home if you are sick. She says there are also still vaccines available.
