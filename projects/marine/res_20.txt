Theres justone more week to go before the Comrades marathon and life at homehas started to mirror the actual race day. The many months of training has prepared KK for the first 60kms of the race. But its the last 30kms or so where hismind needs to take over and he will have torely on mental strength to get himto that finish line. These last couple of days has felt like those final30kms and KK has gone through every emotion possible. But hes not alone. Ive seen other runners going through the same thing, many of them posting to social media. Heres a few which I know both runners and supports will relate to.  The struggles with tapering and worrying if theyve done enough training The nightmares Trying desperately not to get sick   The false niggly aches and pains in the legs The inability to concentrate on anything non-Comrades related The fears The joys  As supporters, we feel it all. But hang in there! Keep calm. Youve Weve got this!
