The steady rise in Quebecers life expectancy has stalled due to particularly bad flu seasons in recent years, the provinces statistics agency says. In 2015, life expectancy was 80.2 years for men and 84.1 years for women. Thats identical to the figures for 2013 and 2014, according to a report published Thursday by the Institut de la statistique du Qubec. The plateauing is in sharp contrast to gains made in previous years. Between the mid-1990sand 2012, on average, menweregaining almost four months of life expectancy per year, while women were gaining a little more than two months per year. In 2015, 64,400 people died in Quebec, up from 61,000 in 2012. The report said the increase is due to the aging population and severe flu seasons during the winters of 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. Until the 1980s, Quebec had the lowest life expectancy in Canada but now has the third highest, after British Columbia and Ontario. Life expectancy in Quebec is higher than in the United States  by 3.8 years for men and 2.9 yearsfor women. At 86.6 years, Japanese women have the highest life expectancy among countries belonging totheOrganization for EconomicCo-operation and Development.
