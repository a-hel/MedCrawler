Today Im sick. My body aches. Ive been up half the night. I havent been able to eat or take more than a sip of water. Im afraid that I will miss my daughters senior banquet tonight. I will miss my last training run before the marathon that I had planned for today. I am too sick to work. Being sick is wrecking all of my plans. I dont like this. I want to fight it. I dont have any control. Im (gulp) only human. I must rest..
